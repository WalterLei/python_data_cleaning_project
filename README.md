# python_data_cleaning_project

Data cleaning is an important skill for data engineers, encompassing reading, modifying, splitting, and storing data.

In this peoject, I will apply my data-cleaning skills to process information about marketing campaigns run by a bank.

They have supplied me with a csv file called "bank_marketing.csv", which I will then clean, reformat, and split the data, saving three final csv files. Specifically, the three files should have the names and contents as requested.

I will demonstrate my skills to modify values, add new features, convert data types, and save data into multiple files.
